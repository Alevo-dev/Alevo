# Alevo product app (`app.getalevo.com`)

Multi-tenant AI SDR platform. This is the authenticated product app; the
marketing site is `apps/web`. Full product plan: [`/plan.md`](../../plan.md).

> This is Next.js 16 with breaking changes from older versions. Read the guides
> in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing code. Middleware is now
> `proxy.ts` and is **not** an authorization layer.

## Architecture rules (non-negotiable — from plan.md §3)

1. **Tenancy at the database.** Every tenant table has `org_id` + an RLS policy.
   Every tenant query goes through `withOrg()` (from `@alevo/auth`). A test
   (`tests/tenant-isolation.test.ts`) proves org A cannot read org B.
2. **Own the identity tables.** `organizations`, `users`, `memberships` are
   mirrored from Clerk via the webhook. All FKs/RLS/reporting use OUR uuids,
   never Clerk ids. RLS resolves Clerk claims via `app.current_org_id()`,
   `app.current_user_id()`, `app.current_role()`, `app.is_platform_admin()`,
   each wrapped `(select app.fn())` so it runs once per statement.
3. **One auth module.** `@alevo/auth` is the only importer of `@clerk/nextjs`.
   Exposes `getCurrentUser`, `getCurrentOrg`, `requireRole`,
   `requirePlatformAdmin`, `withOrg`. Nothing else imports Clerk.
4. **App roles in our DB.** enum `app_role ('viewer','rep','admin','owner')`.
   Clerk's two free roles only gate "can manage membership". `requireRole()`
   checks the hierarchy.
7. **Verify every webhook.** Signature-verify (svix for Clerk); handlers are
   idempotent on the provider event id via `webhook_events`.
9. **Heavy AI work runs as Inngest steps** in Next.js functions (not Supabase
   Edge Functions). _(Inngest baseline lands in a later phase.)_
12. **Per-org secrets are encrypted** and never returned to the client.
    _(org_secrets lands in a later phase.)_

## Data + auth seams

- **`@alevo/db`** — Drizzle over `postgres-js` through the Supavisor transaction
  pooler (`prepare: false`).
  - `withTenant(claims, fn)` — RLS-enforced: opens a tx, injects
    `request.jwt.claims` with `SET LOCAL`, downgrades to role `authenticated`.
  - `withService(fn)` — RLS **bypass** (connection owner) for webhooks/Inngest.
    No safety net: scope every write by our ids in code. Server-only.
- **`@alevo/auth`** — `withOrg(fn)` wraps `withTenant` with the verified Clerk
  session. Use it for all tenant reads/writes in server components/actions.
- SQL migrations in `/supabase/migrations/` are the **single source of truth**
  (schema + RLS + `app.*` functions + grants). `packages/db/src/schema.ts`
  mirrors them for types; regenerate with `pnpm --filter @alevo/db db:pull`.

## Current schema (migration 0001)

`organizations`, `users`, `memberships` (role `app_role`), `webhook_events`
(idempotency ledger). Coming next: `audit_log`, `plans`, `org_subscriptions`,
`usage_counters`, `org_secrets`, `files`, then the Sprint 2 conversation tables.

## Platform-admin bootstrap

There is no UI to grant super-admin. After signing in once (so the Clerk webhook
mirrors your user), promote yourself:

```sql
update public.users set is_platform_admin = true where email = '<you>@example.com';
```

`supabase/seed.sql` does this for the builder on `supabase db reset`.

## Local dev

Dev runs against a **cloud Supabase dev project** (separate from staging/prod) —
Docker is not used (Docker Desktop on Windows Home needs WSL2). Apply migrations
over the network; no local Postgres required.

```bash
npx supabase link --project-ref <dev-ref>   # one-time; prompts for DB password
npx supabase db push                        # apply supabase/migrations/* to the cloud DB
npx inngest-cli dev                          # later phases
pnpm --filter @alevo/app dev                 # app on :3000
```

In `apps/app/.env.local` (copy from `.env.example`):
- `DATABASE_URL` → the project's **Transaction pooler** string (port 6543, `?pgbouncer=true`).
- `DIRECT_URL` → the project's **Session pooler** string (port 5432).
- Clerk keys + `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`.

`db push` does not run `seed.sql`; run the platform-admin bootstrap manually in
the Supabase SQL editor after your first sign-in. For local Clerk webhooks,
tunnel `:3000` with ngrok and point the Clerk webhook at `/api/webhooks/clerk`.

> Docker alternative (if WSL2 is ever available): `supabase start` + `supabase
> db reset` give the full local stack on `:54322` and run `seed.sql`.

## Observability

Sentry is wired (`instrumentation.ts`, `sentry.*.config.ts`,
`instrumentation-client.ts`) and is a no-op until `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is
set. Source-map upload (withSentryConfig) is intentionally not enabled yet.
